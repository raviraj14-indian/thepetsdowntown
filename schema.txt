For ex. breeds like Great Dane require more space. so as per breed, the 
This in itself is reservation history, separate table not needed



===================================

This table will be prepopulated for 2 years in the DB.
This would allow admin to change the rate for a given day
This Rate API will be available only for the admins.

What payment options are supported?
Credit card, debit card.?
Since the application is small, I'd recommend to just use the QR code to accept payments.
Customers can scan the QR code and make payments. Please note we're just using QR code image, there will be no integration between our system and the UPI system.
admin will have to manually update reservation status if paid, refunded or canceled in the 1st iteration.
As the application grows, the admin/client can think of improvements and support multiple payment options and leverage PSP's in the subsequent versions of the application.
